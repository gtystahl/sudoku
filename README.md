This contains an AI that will solve sudoku.

It is run through the driver.py. 

It requires a in.txt that contains on one line a puzzle configuration with 0s being empty squares.

It will try and solve the puzzle with forward checking and arc search. 

If it is unsolvable, it will print out the same line given with a fail. Otherwise the solution will be added to an output.txt
